## Lunitely Manual Install Guide
*This is just a quick guide on what is different from the normal Arch Linux installation*
- [Arch Linux Install Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)



In the Live Environment, NetworkManager is used instead of IWD, so
- `nmtui`/`nmcli` instead of `iwctl`

The Lunitely Repository can be easily installed by running 
- `curl repo.hackrland.dev | sudo bash`

----

If you want to use the Lunitely Boot Animation install the `boot-animation` package from the Lunitely Repository
